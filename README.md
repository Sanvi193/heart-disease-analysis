# Heart Disease Risk Factor Analysis  
A data analysis project exploring key risk factors associated with heart disease using the UCI Heart Disease Dataset.

## 📌 Overview
This project analyzes medical data from 1,025 patients to uncover patterns and relationships related to heart disease.  
Using Python, Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, and Seaborn, we explore age distribution, gender differences, cholesterol ranges, blood pressure patterns, and multivariate correlations.

This project was completed as part of **ITDS 1471 – Data Analysis Using Python**.

## 🧠 Research Questions
1. How is heart disease distributed across different age groups?  
2. Are there significant differences in heart disease rates between males and females?  
3. How do cholesterol levels differ for patients with vs. without heart disease?  
4. How is resting blood pressure related to heart disease diagnosis?  
5. Which combination of health metrics most strongly predicts heart disease?

## 📊 Key Findings
- Heart disease is most common in individuals aged **50–59**.  
- Females had a higher heart disease rate (~76%) compared to males (~42%).  
- Cholesterol levels were **similar** for patients with and without heart disease.  
- Resting blood pressure showed **no strong** difference between groups.  
- Atypical angina was found to be the most significant chest pain–related predictor.
